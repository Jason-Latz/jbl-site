## Session log

### 2026-06-11 — Stage 1.5 + Stage 2 SHIPPED — pushed to origin/the-desk

Branch strategy per Jason: `main` stays the live regular site; The Desk
develops on `origin/the-desk` (Vercel auto-builds a preview deployment for it).
Local worktree branch tracks origin/the-desk. Merge to main only when Jason
calls it ready.

(~146 commits total at push time.)

Everything below this entry's plan landed. Final state:

- 9 artisan rebuilds committed individually (mahogany desk, plank/plaster room,
  full Forså with continuous-wire spring, 78-key MacBook, hardcover books incl.
  On the Edge displayed flat, Staunton chess (extruded knight heads; frame grew to
  0.3232m — clearance checked), refined turntable, curled notepad, weathered crate).
- MacBook pose system: rests CLOSED (stickers up), AJAR ~10° in dark mode (screen-
  light leak, leak curve x10), opens ~110° on work focus; orientation yaw 2.89 so
  the open screen faces the camera; sticker hover/click shows the anchored
  Made-with-Claude chip (drei Html + .desk-credit-anchored).
- Focus system: CameraDirector flights, 4 panels wired (records w/ live needle
  state + heavy-rotation wall, work digest, reading, guestbook), ESC/back returns,
  /?focus=records|work|reading|notes deep links.
- Real album art: vinyl label disc + crate sleeve fronts load via /api/image-proxy
  (procedural placeholders until arrival). /api/spotify/albums aggregates history.
- Guestbook verified END-TO-END through the real UI (posted + read + deleted via
  psql; table left empty). Records/work/reading panels verified via deep links
  with REAL data (Vulcan/Northwestern digest, real covers, live white-noise track).
- Lighting tuned: lamp spot 5.8, themed ACES exposure 0.72-1.12.
- Production build green: homepage first-load 107 kB, scene chunk lazy.

STILL NEEDS JASON'S HAND-CHECK: in-canvas clicks (lamp toggle, object focus,
sticker chip) — R3F raycasts can't be driven synthetically; the HUD/panel paths
that share the same handlers all work. And speakers for the synthesized audio.

Deferred (see PLAN): notes admin UI, notes inked onto the 3D pad texture,
Stage 3 chess, Stage 4 list. Preview-tool quirk reminder: viewport emulation
breaks after page reloads — reset preset desktop → custom size, avoid reloads.

### 2026-06-10 (later still) — Stage 1.5 fidelity pass + Stage 2 (original plan)

Jason's verbatim mandate, recorded for compaction safety: Stage 1 reads nice but not
lifelike enough except the turntable. Make EVERY object "borderline lifelike" — his
philosophy: no variable input, just fixed views, so precompute/spend freely like a
film render. Specific calls: desk is "four rectangular legs and a rectangle" → wants
deep mahogany; lamp needs more detail + springs; books deeper; computer much deeper;
chess set "looks like it was made in Roblox" → real profiles. Camera: a little more
top-down, "at least a 45-degree angle looking down, maybe a little more". Add a
"Made with Claude" mark in a corner (he will cite Claude). Keep commit count for the
fidelity pass modest, THEN implement Stage 2 fully. Attitude: "Create a piece of
genuine artwork that you can be proud of."

PROGRESS CHECKPOINT (mid-session, for compaction recovery):

DONE + COMMITTED: filmic pipeline (ACES + themed exposure, PCSS SoftShadows,
AccumulativeShadows 120-frame bake on desk top wrapped in a z-scaled group because
drei types scale as number, Lightformer environment, SMAA+Bloom(threshold 1)+
Vignette composer — verified in both themes, looks dramatically better); camera at
~45° both rigs; lacquer material helpers; "Made with Claude" credit chip;
CameraDirector focus-flight system (FOCUS_VIEWS in layout.ts: records/work/
reading/notes; clicking turntable/macbook/bookshelf/notepad flies to a fixed
close-up + DeskPanel glass shell slides in; ESC or back returns; orbit only at
rest); desk_notes table CREATED IN SUPABASE (additive, RLS no public policies);
panel content CSS primitives (.desk-panel-*) in globals.css.

IN FLIGHT (two background workflows):
- desk-fidelity-pass (wf_0e6b3c40-e34): 9 artisan agents rewriting IN PLACE with
  unchanged contracts: Desk(mahogany), Room(planks/plaster), DeskLamp(full Forså +
  springs + QA fix: inner dome must not read lit when off), MacBook(3D keys,
  raised sticker decals), Bookshelf+books.ts(hardcovers, page blocks, adds
  review: null — never fabricate reviews), Chessboard(real Staunton lathe
  profiles), Turntable(refine only, keep behavior), Notepad(page curl), Crate.
- desk-stage2-fanout (wf_7d0c92b0-16c): notes-stack (/api/desk-notes GET/POST w/
  sha256 ip rate limit 3/hr + blocklist; NotesPanel), media-routes (/api/spotify/
  albums top-12 from history; /api/image-proxy with scdn/mzstatic allowlist),
  RecordsPanel (props: spotify, phase, canPlay, onToggleNeedle), WorkPanel (digest
  of real experience page, no fabrication), ReadingPanel (BOOKS, review-or-
  "on its way").

NEW DIRECTIVE FROM JASON (mid-flight, supersedes parts of the macbook brief):
1. MacBook rests CLOSED (lid stickers face UP at the 45° camera — fixes the
   "facing backwards" look). Clicking it OPENS the lid (damped hinge to ~110°)
   as part of the work-focus camera flight; closing the panel folds it back.
   Orientation flips ~π so keyboard/screen face the camera when open. Dark mode
   rest pose = lid AJAR ~7° with a thin screen-glow leak (keeps the dark-mode
   soul). Implementation: add { pose: "closed" | "ajar" | "open" } (or open+theme
   internally) prop AFTER the artisan macbook agent lands; damp hinge angle;
   screen emissive scales with openness. Update FOCUS_VIEWS.work to face the
   screen from +z; placement yaw flips.
2. "Made with Claude" corner chip REMOVED (already done). Replacement: hovering/
   clicking any Claude sticker on the lid shows a small anchored chip at the
   sticker (drei <Html> inside MacBook, reusing .desk-credit styles): "Made with
   Claude" + note that the stickers are on Jason's real laptop, linking out.
   Sticker clicks stopPropagation so they don't trigger the work focus.
3. WorkPanel must include GitHub (github.com/Jason-Latz) + resume/projects links.

AFTER WORKFLOWS LAND (my integration, in order): commit each agent file; wire real
panels into DeskHero (replace placeholder; RecordsPanel gets the existing needle
state); hand-wire crate sleeves + vinyl label to real album art via /api/spotify/
albums + /api/image-proxy (small prop additions to RecordCrate/Turntable AFTER
artisan versions land); preview QA both themes + focus flights + guestbook POST;
stop dev server before npm run build; docs + memory closeout.

### Earlier sessions

### 2026-06-10 (later) — Stage 1 COMPLETE on branch

Stage 1 shipped in ~35 granular commits. The homepage is the 3D desk: all seven
objects placed, live Spotify on the platter, full needle-drop audio chain working,
theme-as-lamp crossfade, designed fallback, production build green (homepage
first-load 103 kB; scene chunk lazy).

Verified live in the preview browser:

- Spotify → HUD → iTunes match → stream proxy → playback: end-to-end with the real
  account (matched "Head First — Snazzy", high confidence, ~1 MB proxied stream).
- Needle phases cycle idle → Lowering… → Lift the needle, and the natural 30-second
  end lifts the arm via onEnded.
- Theme bridge in both directions (attribute flip crossfades the whole scene; dark
  mode = lamp off + MacBook screen glow spilling on the desk).
- Mobile (375×812): portrait camera rig frames the turntable cluster; hero capped
  at 62svh; HUD wraps.

NEEDS JASON'S MANUAL CHECK (cannot be driven synthetically): clicking the lamp and
the deck in-canvas (R3F raycasts from offsetX, synthetic events carry zero) — the
HUD button shares the same handler and works, so risk is low. Also: real speakers —
the synthesized thunk/crackle were only verified to schedule without errors.

Fixes that came out of visual QA (committed separately): lamp yaw -0.6 so the beam
lands on the turntable; MacBook turned to 3/4 with lighter aluminum + bigger
stickers; tonearm metal darkened; desktop camera pulled back; portrait rig + aspect
re-ease; mobile hero height cap.

Gotchas discovered (also in CLAUDE.md): dev server vs `next build` share .next and
conflict; preview-tool viewport emulation breaks after page reloads (resize again,
avoid reloads, lean on HMR); iTunes previews arrive as audio/x-m4p but play fine.

### 2026-06-10 — Stage 1 kickoff (branch `claude/goofy-jang-fa9bd0`)

**State: in progress.** Docs landed; three.js stack going in next; object build fan-out
after the scene shell compiles.

What exists so far on this branch: see PLAN.md Stage 1 checkboxes (kept current).

Decisions made this session:

- R3F v8 + drei v9 pinned (React 18 / Next 14 compatibility — fiber v9 needs React 19).
- Procedural modeling only; every object its own file under `components/desk/objects/`.
- Desk coordinate system: meters, desk top surface at y=0, objects base-at-origin;
  placement centralized in `components/desk/layout.ts`.
- Audio is synthesized (no binary assets in repo); previews via iTunes Search because
  Spotify deprecated `preview_url` for API apps as new as this one.
- Lamp semantics per Jason: light mode = lamp ON, dark = lamp OFF/warm dim; lamp click
  toggles global theme via the existing `data-theme` + `site-theme` localStorage system.
- Worktree note: copied `.env` from main checkout (worktrees don't inherit it).

Known issues / gotchas discovered:

- **Pre-existing build break at branch point:** `app/layout.tsx` imported
  `@mdxeditor/editor/style.css` but the dep only exists in the uncommitted editor
  overhaul in Jason's main checkout. RESOLVED on this branch: dropped the vestigial
  import and copied `lib/postTypes.ts` verbatim (two "Unblock build" commits). When
  the editor-overhaul work lands from the main checkout, those two commits are
  superseded — re-check layout.tsx then.

## Architecture snapshot

- Homepage (`app/page.tsx`): `<DeskHero/>` (client, dynamic-imports the Canvas scene,
  WebGL + reduced-motion detection, designed fallback) above the existing HTML sections.
- `components/desk/DeskScene.tsx` — Canvas, camera/orbit clamps, lighting rig, object
  placement, interaction wiring.
- `components/desk/objects/*` — one procedural object per file.
- `lib/three/materials.ts` — shared wood/chrome/plastic/paper materials +
  `makeCanvasTexture` for spines/stickers/labels.
- `components/desk/useSiteTheme.ts` — bridge to `data-theme` (MutationObserver) with
  `toggle()` writing localStorage, used by lamp + lighting.
- `lib/useSpotifyLive.ts` — 45s poller of `/api/spotify/live` (shared shape with the
  legacy ribbon component).
- `lib/audio/turntable-audio.ts` — Web Audio engine (needle thunk, crackle, preview
  element chain + analyser).
- `app/api/audio/preview/route.ts` — iTunes Search match (cached);
  `app/api/audio/stream/route.ts` — allowlisted same-origin audio proxy.
- `content/books.ts` — bookshelf data (current + favorites shelves).

## Content facts (verified)

- Current shelf: *The Power Law* — Sebastian Mallaby; *On the Edge* — Nate Silver.
- Favorites shelf: *The Wise Man's Fear* — **Patrick Rothfuss** (Jason first said
  Sanderson — corrected, he's aware); *Moonwalking with Einstein* — Joshua Foer.
- Lamp: IKEA Forså, chrome. Laptop: MacBook-Pro-like with 3 Claude sunburst stickers.

## Next steps (whoever picks this up)

1. Finish Stage 1 per PLAN.md checkboxes, committing granularly.
2. After Stage 1 visual QA, ask Jason for screenshots-approval, then push/PR.
3. Stage 2 starts with the records panel (data already in Supabase).
